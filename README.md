# Generating AUV Trajectories for Optimal State Estimation 

This simulation uses dynamic programming to generate trajectories that minimize the state error between ground truth position and position estimates generated by a particle filter for a simulated AUV system. Detailed results, methods, and figures are available in the attached AUV_Project_Paper.pdf file.
